#HW 5 Paper from 2013

###Refrence:
A. MacHiry, R. Tahiliani, and M. Naik. Dynodroid: An input
generation system for android apps. Technical report,
Program Analysis Group, Georgia Tech, 2012.

###Keywords:
***1)*** Black-box: A system in which input is inserted, and an output can be viewed. How the output is formed from the input is not known.

***2)*** Automated: A system in which manual effort is not required. More efficient and less time consuming than manual processes.

***3)*** Systematic Testing: Testig by executing unique program paths. Costly and difficult to scale as a result of path explosion problem.

***4)*** Model-based Testing: Uses map of GUI elements to determine what to test. 

###Paper Contents
***1)*** Baseline Results: Dynodroid compares its code coverage to that of two other popular input techniques. Results are shown as graphs. 

***4)*** Related Work: Mentions several other android testing frameworks that Dynodroid either uses or is comparing itself against.

***5)*** Commentary: Includes two larger sections of pusdocode within this paper. They are used to detail how two different algorithms opperate and are later used to compare thier effectiveness against eachother.

***8)*** Informative Visualizations: Latter half of the paper includes several visualizations. Some visualizations display state transitions or dataflow. The Second to last page contains several graphs dealing with code coverage.

###Needs Improvment:
***1)*** Some of the visualizations have issues. For example, Figure 3 has really small font compared to the rest of the paper. The figures that deal with code coverage are all really busy and a little confusing at first glance.

***2)*** Paper overall was wordy and took a while to explain a lot of background information that may not have been needed. The second half of the paper felt a lot more fluid.
