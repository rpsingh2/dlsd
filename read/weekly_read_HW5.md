#HW 5 Paper from 2013

###Refrence:
A. MacHiry, R. Tahiliani, and M. Naik. Dynodroid: An input
generation system for android apps. Technical report,
Program Analysis Group, Georgia Tech, 2012.

###Keywords:
***1)*** Black-box: A system in which input is inserted, and an output can be viewed. How the output is formed from the input is not known.

***2)*** Automated: A system in which manual effort is not required. More efficient and less time consuming than manual processes.

***3)*** Systematic Testing: Testig by executing unique program paths. Costly and difficult to scale as a result of path explosion problem.

***4)*** Model-based Testing: Uses map of GUI elements to determine what to test. 

###Paper Contents
***1)*** Motivational Statments: 
***4)*** Related Work: Mentions several other android testing frameworks that Dynodroid either uses or is comparing itself against.
***5)*** Commentary: Includes two sections of pusdocode that detail how two different algorithms opperate.
***8)*** Informative Visualizations: Latter half of the paper includes several visualizations. Some visualizations display state transitions or dataflow. The Second to last page contains several graphs dealing with code coverage.
