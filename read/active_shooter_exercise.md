## Active Shooter Exercise.

####1. Things NOT to do:

***1.1. Gather***: You should not gather up at one spot when a shooting occurs. This just makes it easier for the shooter to get a good focus on all the people in one go. Instead, you should be spread out as across the space while trying not be in direct line of sight. This causes the shooter to get confused and gives you a window of oppurtunity to take combative steps. 

***1.2. Assume someone else will summon the Authorities***: One should not assume that someone else would have reported the shootout to the Authorities and called for help. They should themselves take responsibility and reach out to proper Authorities and provide concise and complete information.

####2. Things to do:

***2.1. Be aware***: Always be aware of your surroundings and the people around you. This doesâ€™t mean that you have to be critical and untrusting of each and everyone. This just entails general awareness so that you are better prepared to handle a crisis in case one arises. For eg., when you are in a public setting such as a classroom, you should be cognizant of the escape routes, doors, hiding spots etc. 

***2.2. Positive attitude***: In case of a shootout, always believe that you will be able to survive and make through the situation. This helps you to focus on the right steps that you should take for yourself and guide others to survive.
